### Binding
The E1743 can be bound to groups using [binding](../information/binding).
It can only be bound to 1 group at a time.

Note that < zigbee2mqtt 1.4 automatically bound this device to group 99.
If you want to bind it to a different group you first have to unbind it from group 99.

Pair the remote to Zigbee2mqtt by holding it close to the coordinator and
pressing the button next to the battery 4 times. The red light on the remote will now flash a few times.

    {
        model: 'PP-WHT-US',
        note: `
### Pairing
Additional steps are required because the Peanut Smart Plug does not provide a \`modelId\` in its database entry,
and thus zigbee2mqtt cannot identify the product or how to handle it.

Reset the device and initiate pairing mode by holding the pairing button
(the small button next to the on/off button) for ten seconds, releasing the button,
and unplugging the device.
When plugged back in, the front LED will be blinking red and ready to receive a pairing request.
When paired successfully, the red LED on the plug will stop blinking.

After pairing, you must stop zigbee2mqtt and manually edit the zigbee2mqtt \`database.db\` file with a
text editor (note that the file may be owned by root).
Find each line where the Peanut Smart Plug is listed (look for "SecuriFi Ltd." in the \`ManufName\` field)
and **add** \`"modelId":"PP-WHT-US",\` between two existing fields.

*For example,* change \`..."manufId":4098,"manufName":"Securifi Ltd....\`
to \`..."manufId":4098,"modelId":"PP-WHT-US","manufName":"Securifi Ltd....\`
on each line for the device.

Save the file and restart zigbee2mqtt.

### Pairing
Some of the Gledopto devices are not providing a \`modelID\`, in that case the modelID \`undefined\` is shown.
Sometimes it helps to repair the device while keeping it close to the coordinator (less than one meter).

If this fails, the \`modelID\` has to be set manually in \`data/database.db\`.
First find out the \`modelID\` of your devices from
the [Supported devices page](../information/supported_devices.md).
Then open \`data/database.db\` and add the \`modelId\` as highlighted in **bold** below.

### Pairing
Philips LivingColors IRIS and Philips LivingColors Bloom Devices that comes with
Philips (HUE) Remote Gen 2 (Touch Wheel) or Gen 3 (Round Click Wheel) can be paired via Zigbee.
Devices with Gen 1 Remote don't use Zigbee and can not be paired.
The Philips LivingColors Remote can not be paired via Zigbee because it only support ZigBee Light Link (ZLL).

To Pair hold Button ON and Bottom Left Key (Favorite 1) on the Remote in Front of the Device until
the Device Light blinks and lights Orange. If connection was succesfull the Device Light will light Green.

**WARNING**: If you pair your Device to a Zigbee Network which is not using a ZLL Channel
you can't reset the Device with the Philips LivingColors Remote Gen 3.
The Gen 3 Remote will only try ZLL Channels to find the Device! Maybe it's possible to reset
the Device with a Philips LivingColors Remote Gen 2 as it should try all Zigbee Channels to find the Device.

When the bulb is still connected to the Hue bridge, you can simply factory reset the bulb
by removing it from the bridge via the Hue app.

### Device type specific configuration
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../configuration/device_specific_configuration.md)*

* \`no_occupancy_since\`: Timeout (in seconds) after \`no_occupancy_since\` is send.
This indicates the time since last occupancy was detected.
For example \`no_occupancy_since: [10, 60]\` will send a \`{"no_occupancy_since": 10}\` after 10 seconds
and a \`{"no_occupancy_since": 60}\` after 60 seconds.
* \`occupancy_timeout\`: Timeout (in seconds) after the \`occupancy: false\` message is sent.
If not set, the timeout is \`90\` seconds.
When set to \`0\` no \`occupancy: false\` is send.

**IMPORTANT**: \`occupancy_timeout\` should not be set to lower than 60 seconds.
The reason is this: after detecting a motion the sensor ignores any movements for
exactly 60 seconds. In case there are movements after this, a new message
(\`occupancy: true\`) will be sent and the sensor will go for one more minute sleep, and so on.
This is expected behaviour (see [#270](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/270#issuecomment-414999973)).
To work around this, a
[hardware modification](https://community.smartthings.com/t/making-xiaomi-motion-sensor-a-super-motion-sensor/139806)
